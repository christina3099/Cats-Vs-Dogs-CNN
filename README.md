# Cats-Vs-Dogs-CNN
In this project, I have trained a CNN model to classify cats and Dog images. I have been able to achieve training accuracy of 92% and val_accuracy: 82%
Beyond that it was observed that the model was overfitting and though the training accuracy went upto 96% the validation accuracy kept decreasing. 
This overfitting could be improved by various techniques. As for now I stop here, Probably would get back here some other time to experiment with regularization, dropout implementation!
